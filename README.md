# Unity2022VisualScripting
Repo of Unity visual scripting machine graphs in Unity asset format.

Drag and drop graph requires two Object variables: deltaX, of type float and deltaY also of type float.  Visual Scripting will automatically add variables to the script graph machine if they aren't explicitly declared in the varialbles section of the Visual Scripting component.  Adding the Visual Scripting component to a game object automatically adds a variable section to the component.

Added code to automatically add two components to the game object: Box Collider 2D and Rigid Body 2D.
