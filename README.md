# Unity2022VisualScripting
Repo of Unity visual scripting machine graphs in Unity asset format.

Drag and drop graph requires two Object variables: deltaX, of type float and deltaY also of type float.

Added code to automatically add two components to the game object: Box Collider 2D and Rigid Body 2D.
